This project was created to integrate the native query server implementation from [ColBERT](https://github.com/stanford-futuredata/ColBERT) with the index management and document handling capabilities of [RAGatouille](https://github.com/bclavie/RAGatouille). My goal was leveraging specific functionalities from both packages while avoiding their dependency conflicts.

Run `make install` to install the dependencies and `make` to run the server.
